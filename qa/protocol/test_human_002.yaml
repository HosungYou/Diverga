      of artificial intelligence in educational contexts cannot be
      overstated. Furthermore, the implementation of sophisticated
      machine learning algorithms has demonstrated unprecedented
      efficacy in optimizing pedagogical outcomes. In essence,

      Why is "It is crucial to acknowledge" flagged as AI pattern?
      I've seen human academics write this way too. How do you
      distinguish AI-generated hedging from human academic hedging?

      In the humanized version, you changed "cannot be overstated" to
      something else. What's wrong with that phrase specifically?
      It seems like normal academic writing to me.

      Wait - is this ethical? If I humanize AI-generated text and
      don't disclose I used AI, isn't that academic dishonesty?
      What are the guidelines here?

      Good points. I'll add an AI disclosure statement.
      Please proceed with the humanization and verify it.
